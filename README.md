# üëã Welcome to your SAS SDET Tech Assessment

Here we are asking you to complete some technical tasks to see what and how you would approach and implement a solution.

We have a frontend app that's been created using React, it allows you to search and listen to music, it uses the Spotify (dev) API's for the information.

## üìÑ The Assignment

As an SDET you will be leaning on your experience in this technical assessment to help test this application, as you will see this application has zero testing at the moment and we need you to pick the tooling and also decide how an what levels to test at...

That being said, we do expect a minimum of the following to be achieved which is explained below.

### üóÉÔ∏è File Structre Breakdown
- `/frontend` - TypeScript React Application
- `/backend` - Java Spring Boot Application

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Assigment 1 - E2E Test 

We need you in the `frontend` codebase we need to ensure the critical path works, which has been [defined here](/documents/critical-path-definition.md). For this you can use whatever language or framework you like.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Assigment 2 - Test Lower

You will now need to decide for this second part of the assessment to if you would prefer to complete it in either `Java` or `Typescript`. If you want to use `Java` please test the `backend` code, if you would like to use `Typescript` please test the `frontend` code.

Within either project ther are various unit and componend/integration tests that need to be implemented as there are ZERO tests right now, please use your experiance on what to test where.

### ‚è∞ Timeframe

Estimated Time: 1-2 Hours (Maximum)

#### ‚è≥ Not enought time?

We understand that you won't be able to implement everything you'd like to get this application up to scratch, please document all your [suggested improvements here](/documents/improvement-suggesstions.md) in as much detail as possible.

#### Things to keep in mind
- Remember to structure and use your code efficiently.
- Think about the testing levels in the pyramid.
- What improvents could you add to this project around anything... code changes, testing, pipelines, tooling.
